## First Interview

The first interview consisted in two exercises:

### A fizzBuzz implementation

In this challenge, you need to write a function that, from 100 to 0, prints 'Fizz' if the number is divisible by 3, prints 'Buzz' if the number is divisible by 5, and prints 'FizzBuzz' if divisible by both.

### Omit

In this challenge, you need to write a function that removes a list of properties from an existing object. This should be in the way of `omit(obj, 'a', 'b', 'c')`. The function should accept variable parameters to be removed.

## Second Interview

In this challenge, you need to sum a multi-level array with multiple types of data in it.
