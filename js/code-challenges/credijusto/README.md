Language Characteristics
Letter Classification
Googlon letters are classified in two groups

The letters (u, d, x, s, m, p, f) are called foo letters.
The other letters are called bar letters.
Prepositions
In the Googlon language, the prepositions are the words of exactly 6 letters which end in a foo letter and do not contain the letter u.

Verbs
In the Googlon language, verbs are words of 6 letters or more, that end in a bar letter.

Furthermore, if a verb starts in a bar letter, then the verb is inflected in its subjunctive form.

Lexicographical Order
In Googlon, like in our system, words are always ordered lexicographically, but the challenge is that the order of the letters in the Googlon alphabet is different from ours. Their alphabet, in order, is: sxocqnmwpfyheljrdgui.

Numbers
In Googlon, words also represent numbers given in base 20, where each letter is a digit. The digits are ordered from the least significant to the most significant, which is the opposite of our system. That is, the leftmost digit is the unit, the second digit is worth 20, the third one is worth 400, and so on and so forth.

The values of the letters are given by the order they appear in the Googlon alphabet (which, as we saw, is ordered differently from our alphabet). That is, the first letter of the Googlon alphabet represents the digit 0, the second letter represents the digit 1, and the last one represents the digit 19.

As an example, the Googlon word gxjrc represents the number 605637.

Googlons consider a number to be pretty if it satisfies all of the following properties:

it is greater than or equal to 81827
it is divisible by 3
