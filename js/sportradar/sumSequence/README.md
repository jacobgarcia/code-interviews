# Sum of integers
### Programming challenge description:
Write a program to determine the largest sum of contiguous integers in a sequence. Contiguous means that the integers are adjacent to each other. Take -4, 2, -5, 0, 3 as an example. For this example the largest sum would be 3 and was obtained from the subsequence 0, 3.
Input:
Your program should read lines of text from standard input. Each line will contain a sequence of comma-separated integers.
Output:
For each line of input, print to standard output the sum of the largest contiguous subsequence in each sequence, one integer per line. In other words, of all the possible contiguous subsequences for a given set, find the one with the largest sum, and print that sum.
