# Stack Implementation
### Programming challenge description:
Write a program implementing a stack interface for integers. The interface should have 'push' and 'pop' functions. You will be asked to 'push' a series of integers and then 'pop' and print out every alternate integer.
Input:
Your program should read lines of text from standard input. Each line contains a sequence of space delimited integers.
Output:
